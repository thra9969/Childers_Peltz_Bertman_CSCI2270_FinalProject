Project Summary:
This program is a twenty questions game where the user is asked a series of twenty pre-determined questions from a linked list and attempt to ‘guess’ what the object the user is thinking of. Their answers to the questions are recorded and the program then determines a best-fit match from a linked list of known objects with assigned response answers. Because of limited time and resources, the questions are limited to household pets.
